Why was JavaScript created?

Netscape and Eich designed JavaScript as a scripting language for use with the company's flagship web browser, 
Netscape Navigator. Initially known as LiveScript, Netscape changed the name to JavaScript so they could position
 it as a companion for the Java language, a product of their partner, Sun Microsystems.
